# Contributing to PNPL

We love your input! We want to make contributing to PNPL as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style

We follow the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) with some modifications:

- Use `snake_case` for variables and functions
- Use `PascalCase` for classes and structs
- Use `UPPER_CASE` for constants
- Maximum line length is 100 characters
- Use 4 spaces for indentation

## Documentation

- All public APIs must be documented
- Use Doxygen-style comments for all public interfaces
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes

## Testing

- Write unit tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Maintain or improve test coverage

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if needed
2. Update the documentation if you've changed APIs
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one other developer

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/yourusername/pnpl/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/pnpl/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT License.
